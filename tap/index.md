Summary: TAP - Wearable Electronics Project

save_as: tap/index.html

Don Powrie has volunteered to lead us in designing and manufacturing a
wearable electronics project. We are looking for input and participation
in hardware design, software development, and marketing. At the end of
the design phase we will launch a kickstarter as a fundraiser for
TheLab.ms. 

*  The electronic design and software will be open source.

*  Designed to be modded / hacked with your own code.

## The Product
The finished product will be a black printed circuit board with 64 surface mounted red/green/blue LEDs, 
a sweet microcontroller, and 4 expansion conntectors to allow the boards to be interconnected to produce larger displays.

It will be powered by either a micro usb port or by coin cells.

It can be programmed using in several way like a traditional hardware development platform.
It can also be controlled iexternally by a number of different devices such as Arduino, TI Launchpad, Pi, and more.
Or for the less programatically inclined it can be given simple instructions on what to display via a micro usb port.

## How you can help:

**Video Production**

**Kickstarter Campaign Planning**

**Firmware Development**

**Become a member**

**Donate**

## When and where we meet:

We meet weekly on Thursday nights. Details can be found on our
[meetup.com site](http://www.meetup.com/TheLab-ms/)

## Code repository
Until our crowd funding campaign is launched we have restricted access to our code on [TheLab.ms GitHub](https://github.com/TheLab-ms)

If you are interested in contributing to the code before this restriction is lifted please contact [TheLab.ms leadership](mailto:leadership@thelab.ms) to be added to the project.
