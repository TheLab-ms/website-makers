Thursday November 12th 19:00 Brew Night
---------------------------------------

Join TheLab.ms for a Brew Night event on Thursday November 12th at 7 PM.
The event will be held in the garage/driveway of [703 Cypress Drive in
Allen TX 75002](https://goo.gl/maps/l7MTr). This event is open to anyone
over 21 years of age who wishes to spectate and learn the brewing
process. However, only paying members of TheLab.ms over 21 years of age
can participate in brewing their own batch.

This brew night will have TheLab.ms members brew a Pumpkin Spice Latte
Milk Stout. I've named this beer **PSL.ms** as Pumpkin Spice Latte Milk
Stout is a bit long winded for a name. This will be a complicated brew
but should be well worth it. After all, it has what girls crave!

If you are a paying member of TheLab.ms over 21 years of age and wish to
participate in brewing your own batch, then you will need to add a
comment to this event indicating that so we can purchase your
ingredients. Other than the ingredients you will need to bring all your
own equipment.

We look forward to seeing you at the event!
