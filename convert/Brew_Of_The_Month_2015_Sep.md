Thursday September 24th 19:00 Brew Night
----------------------------------------

Join TheLab.ms for a Brew Night event on Thursday September 24th at 7
PM. The event will be held in the garage/driveway of [703 Cypress Drive
in Allen TX 75002](https://goo.gl/maps/l7MTr). This event is open to
anyone over 21 years of age who wishes to spectate and learn the brewing
process. However, only paying members of TheLab.ms over 21 years of age
can participate in brewing their own batch.

This brew night will have TheLab.ms members brew an extract recipe for a
light lager in the Mexican style (e.g. Corona, Tecate, Modelo, etc.).
I've named this beer **The Mexican** in honor of the style we are trying
to achieve. This will be an extract brew instead of our traditional all
grain recipes.

If you are a paying member of TheLab.ms over 21 years of age and wish to
participate in brewing your own batch, then you will need to add a
comment to this event indicating that so we can purchase your
ingredients. Other than the ingredients you will need to bring all your
own equipment.

We look forward to seeing you at the event!

### Outline of the event

-   We will review the recipe and ingredients (grains[extract], hops,
    yeast) and discuss why they were chosen.
-   We will add the extract and water to our kettle and bring to a boil.
-   We will boil that wort in the kettle with hops per our recipe.
-   We will crash cool the wort using a wort chiller or ice chest.
-   We will take an original gravity reading of the wort.
-   We will transfer the wort to a fermentation bucket.
-   We will pitch yeast and seal the fermentation bucket with an
    airlock.

### Required Equipment List For Brewers

-   Brew Kettle 10+ Gal capacity
-   Heat source (e.g. Propane burner)
-   Fermentation Bucket 5+ Gal Capacity
