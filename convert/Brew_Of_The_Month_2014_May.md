Thursday May 29th 19:00 Brew Night
----------------------------------

Join TheLab.ms for a Brew Night event on Thursday May 29th at 7 PM. The
event will be held in the garage/driveway of [703 Cypress Drive in Allen
TX 75002](https://goo.gl/maps/l7MTr). This event is open to anyone over
21 years of age who wishes to spectate and learn the brewing process.
However, only paying members of TheLab.ms over 21 years of age can
participate in brewing their own batch.

This brew night will focus on the partial extract brew in a bag method
using an American Pale Ale recipe. I have named this beer **Lawnmower
Man** since it is based on a standard lawnmower style recipe with some
twists added.

If you are a paying member of TheLab.ms over 21 years of age and wish to
participate in brewing your own batch, then you will need to add a
comment to this event indicating that so we can purchase your
ingredients. Other than the ingredients you will need to bring all your
own equipment.

Please use this forum to post any questions or comments you may have:

### Outline of the event

-   We will review the recipe and ingredients (grains, hops, yeast) and
    discuss why they were chosen.
-   We will mill the grains and add them to a grain bag.
-   We will steep the grains in a kettle per our recipe.
-   We will remove the grain bag and add malt extract to the kettle.
-   We will boil that wort in the kettle with hops per our recipe.
-   We will crash cool the wort using a wort chiller or ice chest.
-   We will take an original gravity reading of the wort.
-   We will transfer the wort to a fermentation bucket.
-   We will pitch yeast and seal the fermentation bucket with an
    airlock.
