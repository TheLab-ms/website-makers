Don Powrie has volunteered to lead us in designing and manufacturing a
wearable electronics project. We are looking for input and participation
in hardware design, software development, and marketing. At the end of
the design phase we will launch a kickstarter as a fundraiser for
TheLab.ms. We have a dire shortage of help with photography and video
editing for this project.

• The electronic design and software will be open source.

• Designed to be modded / hacked with your own code.

The Product
-----------

The finished product will be a black printed circuit board with 512
surface mounted red/green/blue LEDs, a sweet microcontroller, and 4
expansion ports to add additional sensors and functionality through
"personality" modules. It will be powered by micro usb port.

*Applications / Use Cases*

• Scrolling Text

• Breathalyzer

• Audio Spectrum Analyzer

• Guitar Tuner

• E-Cig Resistance Tester

• 8 Bit Audio w/ Visualizations

• Wireless communications (Wifi/Bluetooth/IR)
