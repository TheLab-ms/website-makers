Business
--------

### 1st Order of business:

A motion has been raised regarding setting the new membership rates
(vote pushed from a previous meeting where it was agreed rates would go
up Jan 1st without specifying an amount). The new membership rates being
put to a vote are \$30/Month or \$250/Year. This would go into effect
Jan 1st 2016 for all new members or current plank holder members who
have let their membership lapse.

NOTE: Previous board votes determined that lifetime memberships can no
longer be purchased after 12/31/2015 and that anyone who becomes a
member by 12/31/2015 will be considered a plank holder locking in their
rates at \$20/\$200 for as long as they remain a member in good
standing. This vote would not change these rules. This vote is to set
the new membership fees.

Vote on approving the new membership fees of \$30/Month or \$250/Year
effective 1/1/2016:

-   Vote: 5 in favor, 0 opposed, 0 abstained
-   Resolution: Vote passed
