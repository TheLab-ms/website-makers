Business
--------

### 1st Order of business:

Due to the decisions being made and the conflicts being spawned by our
interim CTO Dwight Spencer, a motion has been made to remove him from
office to prevent further damage to TheLab.ms in the public eye. Since
this was only an interim position and not one that was formally voted in
by the membership (since we have not yet had our first annual meeting)
it is the position of the board that we have the authority to remove
Dwight Spencer from the role of CTO. The CTO position will remain vacant
until the annual membership meeting where the members will elect all
officers for the year.

Vote to remove Dwight Spencer as interim CTO:

-   Vote: 3 in favor, 0 opposed, 0 abstained
-   Resolution: Vote passed
