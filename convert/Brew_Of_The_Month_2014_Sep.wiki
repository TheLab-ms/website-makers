== Thursday September 25th 19:00 Brew Night ==
Join TheLab.ms for a Brew Night event on Thursday September 25th at 7 PM. The event will be held in the garage/driveway of [https://goo.gl/maps/l7MTr 703 Cypress Drive in Allen TX 75002]. This event is open to anyone over 21 years of age who wishes to spectate and learn the brewing process. However, only paying members of TheLab.ms over 21 years of age can participate in brewing their own batch.


We will be brewing a wheat beer I have named '''Weize 'n' Rancor''' which is a wheat beer in the German Weizen style with some extra hop Rancor kicking it up a notch.


If you are a paying member of TheLab.ms over 21 years of age and wish to participate in brewing your own batch, then you will need to add a comment to this event indicating that so we can purchase your ingredients. Other than the ingredients you will need to bring all your own equipment. 


Please use this forum to post any questions or comments you may have: [http://forum.thelab.ms/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=2037 Brew Night Event Sep 25th 7PM]


We look forward to seeing you at the event!


=== Outline of the event ===
* Clean and Sanitize everything.
* Start heating just under 4 Gal of water to 163.5 F for the mash.
* Add PH stabilizer to the water.
* While mash water is heating mill all the grains (don't mill the wheat flakes).
* Add the mash water at 163.5 F to the mash tun (adding grains will reduce this to 150 F).
* Add the grains including wheat flakes to the mash tun stiring to release air trapped in the grains.
* Cap the mash tun and let the grains steep at 150 F for 75 min.
* Start heating about 4 1/2 Gal of water to 168 F for sparging about 50 min after starting steep.
* Add the sparge water at 168 F to the sparge bucket and secure hose for fly sparging.
* Take first runnings from the mash testing sugar content to ensure completion
* Fly sparge the mash adding the wort to the brew kettle at the same rate sparge water enters the mash tun
* Stop collecting wort when you have just under 6 1/2 Gal or when runnings measure 1.010 specific gravity.
* Start heating the wort to a boil.
* Add bittering hops to the wort once it is at a rolling boil and start timing your 60 min boil time.
* Add aroma hops to the wort  50 minutes into the boil (10 min remaining)
* Add irish moss (clarifier) and yeast nutrient to the wort 50 minutes into the boil (10 min remaining)
* When boil is finished remove from heat and crash cool the wort using a chiller
* Once wort has reached approximately 80 F transfer to fermentation bucket
* Take a specific gravity reading and record this as your original gravity
* Pitch yeast and aerate.
* Seal the fermenter with an airlock and wait for it to transform itself into the nectar of the gods.


=== Required Equipment List For Brewers ===
*Mash Tun 10+ Gal capacity with a Spigot
*Brew Kettle 10+ Gal capacity 
*Heat source (e.g. Propane burner) 
*Fermentation Bucket 5+ Gal Capacity with air lock
*Fly Sparge Bucket 5+ Gal Capacity with a Spigot
*Wort Chiller or Ice Chest (Note: This is optional as there will be a plate chiller with pump available for member use)
