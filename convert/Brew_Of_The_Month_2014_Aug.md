Thursday August 28th 19:00 Brew Night
-------------------------------------

Join TheLab.ms for a Brew Night event on Thursday August 28th at 7 PM.
The event will be held in the garage/driveway of [703 Cypress Drive in
Allen TX 75002](https://goo.gl/maps/l7MTr). This event is open to anyone
over 21 years of age who wishes to spectate and learn the brewing
process. However, only paying members of TheLab.ms over 21 years of age
can participate in brewing their own batch.

We will be brewing an Octoberfest Marzen Bier that I have named
**TEXoberfest** as it is the first octoberfest bier I've brewed in
Texas.

If you are a paying member of TheLab.ms over 21 years of age and wish to
participate in brewing your own batch, then you will need to add a
comment to this event indicating that so we can purchase your
ingredients. Other than the ingredients you will need to bring all your
own equipment.

Please use this forum to post any questions or comments you may have:

    Notes:
    ------
    This octoberfest requires a carboy for secondary fermentation and a fermentation cooler 
    to adjust managing the various temperatures required.  
    Primary fermentation will be done at 54 F for 14 days.  
    Then the bier will be racked to the carboy for secondary fermentation at 62 F for 3 days.  
    Finally the bier while still in the carboy will have its temperature reduced 2.2 degrees F per day 
    for the next 10 days making its final daily rest temperature 40 F.  
    The bier should be fully fermented and clarified after this 24 day total primary/secondary/conditioning period.
