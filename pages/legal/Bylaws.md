8 Conflict of Interest Policy
-----------------------------

### 8.1 Article I: Purpose

The purpose of the conflict of interest policy is to protect this
tax-exempt organization&#39;s interest when it is contemplating entering
into a transaction or arrangement that might benefit the private
interest of an officer or director of the Organization or might result
in a possible excess benefit transaction. This policy is intended to
supplement but not replace any applicable state and federal laws
governing conflict of interest applicable to nonprofit and charitable
organizations.

### 8.2 Article II: Definitions:

1 Interested Person Any director, principal officer, or member of a
committee with governing board delegated powers, who has a direct or
indirect financial interest, as defined below, is an interested person.

2 Financial Interest A person has a financial interest if the person
has, directly or indirectly, through business, investment, or family:

a. An ownership or investment interest in any entity with which the
Organization has a transaction or arrangement,

b. A compensation arrangement with the Organization or with any entity
or individual with which the Organization has a transaction or
arrangement, or

c. A potential ownership or investment interest in, or compensation
arrangement with, any entity or individual with which the Organization
is negotiating a transaction or arrangement. Compensation includes
direct and indirect remuneration as well as gifts or favors that are not
insubstantial.

A financial interest is not necessarily a conflict of interest. Under
Article III, Section 2, a person who has a financial interest may have a
conflict of interest only if the appropriate governing board or
committee decides that a conflict of interest exists.

### 8.3 Article III: Procedures

1 Duty to Disclose In connection with any actual or possible conflict
of interest, an interested person must disclose the existence of the
financial interest and be given the opportunity to disclose all material
facts to the directors and members of committees with governing board
delegated powers considering the proposed transaction or arrangement.

2 Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists After disclosure
of the financial interest and all material facts, and after any
discussion with the interested person, he/she shall leave the governing
board or committee meeting while the determination of a conflict of
interest is discussed and voted upon. The remaining board or committee
members shall decide if a conflict of interest exists.

3 Procedures for Addressing the Conflict of Interest

a. An interested person may make a presentation at the governing board
or committee meeting, but after the presentation, he/she shall leave the
meeting during the discussion of, and the vote on, the transaction or
arrangement involving the possible conflict of interest.

b. The chairperson of the governing board or committee shall, if
appropriate, appoint a disinterested person or committee to investigate
alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement.

c. After exercising due diligence, the governing board or committee
shall determine whether the Organization can obtain with reasonable
efforts a more advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or
entity that would not give rise to a conflict of interest.

d. If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably
possible under circumstances not producing a conflict of interest, the
governing board or committee shall determine by a majority vote of the
disinterested directors whether the transaction or arrangement is in the
Organization&#39;s best interest, for its own benefit, and whether it is
fair and reasonable. In conformity with the above determination it shall
make its decision as to whether to enter into the transaction or
arrangement.

4 Violations of the Conflicts of Interest Policy

a. If the governing board or committee has reasonable cause to believe
a member has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of
interest, it shall inform the member of the basis for such belief and
afford the member an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to
disclose.

b. If, after hearing the member&#39;s response and after making further
investigation as warranted by the circumstances, the governing board or
committee determines the member has failed to disclose an actual or
possible conflict of interest, it shall take appropriate disciplinary
and corrective action.

### 8.4 Article IV: Recordings of Proceedings

The minutes of the governing board and all committees with board
delegated powers shall contain:

a. The names of the persons who disclosed or otherwise were found to
have a financial interest in connection with an actual or possible
conflict of interest, the nature of the financial interest, any action
taken to determine whether a conflict of interest was present, and the
governing board&#39;s or committee&#39;s decision as to whether a conflict of
interest in fact existed.

b. The names of the persons who were present for discussions and votes
relating to the transaction or arrangement, the content of the
discussion, including any alternatives to the proposed transaction or
arrangement, and a record of any votes taken in connection with the
proceedings.

### 8.5 Article V: Compensation

a. A voting member of the governing board who receives compensation,
directly or indirectly, from the Organization for services is precluded
from voting on matters pertaining to that member&#39;s compensation.

b. A voting member of any committee whose jurisdiction includes
compensation matters and who receives compensation, directly or
indirectly, from the Organization for services is precluded from voting
on matters pertaining to that member&#39;s compensation.

c. No voting member of the governing board or any committee whose
jurisdiction includes compensation matters and who receives
compensation, directly or indirectly, from the Organization, either
individually or collectively, is prohibited from providing information
to any committee regarding compensation.

### 8.6 Article VI: Annual Statements

Annual Statements Each director, principal officer and member of a
committee with governing board delegated powers shall annually sign a
statement which affirms such person:

a. Has received a copy of the conflicts of interest policy,

b. Has read and understands the policy,

c. Has agreed to comply with the policy, and

d. Understands the Organization is charitable and in order to maintain
its federal tax exemption it must engage primarily in activities which
accomplish one or more of its tax exempt purposes.

### 8.7 Article VII: Periodic Reviews

To ensure the Organization operates in a manner consistent with
charitable purposes and does not engage in activities that could
jeopardize its tax-exempt status, periodic reviews shall be conducted.
The periodic reviews shall, at a minimum, include the following
subjects:

a. Whether compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable, based
on competent survey information, and the result of arm&#39;s length
bargaining.

b. Whether partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with
management organizations conform to the Organization&#39;s written policies,
are properly recorded, reflect reasonable investment or payments for
goods and services, further charitable purposes and do not result in
inurement, impermissible private benefit or in an excess benefit
transaction.

### 8.8 Article VIII: Use of Outside Experts

When conducting the periodic reviews as provided for in Article VII, the
Organization may, but need not, use outside advisors. If outside experts
are used, their use shall not relieve the governing board of its
responsibility for ensuring periodic reviews are conducted.
