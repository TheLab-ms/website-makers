Supplemental Rules
==================

This page is where you will find all the rules which have been passed by
the Board to supplement the Bylaws. These supplemental rules will cover
venue specific rules, procedures for various tasks and/or services, and
more detailed explanations of certain Bylaws that needed clarification.

Membership
----------

### Membership Agreement

All members are required to fulfill the responsibilities outlined in the
[Membership\_Agreement](Membership_Agreement.html).

### Dues Amount

Per our Bylaws the dues amount will be set by the board and posted here
and at our space. `
<pre>
          The board of directors will set the amount of dues required for membership. 
          This will be posted at the corporationâ€™s registered location and on the membership application forms.
</pre>

Here are the current membership Dues amounts that are in effect since 01/01/2016:

Type                       | Amount              | Description

General Rules and Clarifications
--------------------------------

### Membership Points

We wanted to further clarify membership points as defined in our Bylaws.

Here is they text from the Bylaws section on membership points:

`
<pre>
          Members can be awarded Membership Points (Points) for various things they do that benefit the space. 
          Points can be redeemed for items purchased from TheLab.ms and/or used to reduce a member&#39;s dues. 
          Points can be earned by:
                  * Bringing in donations from third parties (cumulative throughout the year) $100 gets 1 Point, 
                         then an additional point every $200 thereafter.
                  * Running a public event of ten or more attendees or class of five or more earns 1 Point. 
                         Only one member can receive a Point award per event or class.
                  * Performing a substantive, significant service to TheLAB.MS (as determined by the Board of Directors). 
                         For example: a cleanup event, organizing a large scale party, donor event, etc.

          Things Points can be redeemed for:
                    Get 1 month of Member status for no charge.
                    Other, as determined by the Board of Directors.

          The Treasurer shall maintain record of Points.

          Points have no cash value, and they expire 12 months after issuance. 
          Points may be transferred from member to member by contacting the Treasurer.
</pre>
`

Here is some clarification on the membership points:

-   The term LabCoins is also used to reference membership points.
-   Points earned from bringing in third party donations are awarded
    when the end of fiscal year data is calculated.
    -   Third party donations credited to a member through Dec 31st will
        count towards that fiscal years point award for that member
    -   If multiple members worked on securing the same third party
        donation then they will each get credited for a percentage of
        that donation
    -   The membership points will be credited and reported to members
        at approximately the same time that end of year receipts are
        sent out
-   The term 'public event with ten or more attendees' was meant to
    refer to our larger events such as SlingFest or BSidesDFW.
    -   Only one person can receive a single membership point per event
        and the board will determine which member gets the point
-   The term 'class of five or more' was meant to refer to a class
    lesson plan being taught and not each instance of teaching that
    class
    -   For example, the Arduino class that was put together to teach at
        local libraries would qualify in its entirety for a single
        point, not one point per library it was taught at
    -   Only one person can receive a single membership point per class
        lesson plan and the board will determine which member gets the
        point
-   Those services that the board deems significant enough to merit a
    membership point will be identified and communicated to the
    membership
-   In the Bylaws sections on Area Hosts it mentions the possibility of
    members being able to earn points by taking on this responsibility
    at the discretion of the board.
    -   This role has not been fully defined in our new space as of yet.
    -   Once it is defined we will post more details on how membership
        points can be eared from it here.

Here are some rule supplements in regards to membership points:

-   Additional ways that members can earn points:
    -   Members can be rewarded for time they volunteer helping
        TheLab.ms with events and classes and other tasks.
        -   Each 20 hours a member volunteers can be redeemed for a
            membership point.
-   Additional items that points can be redeemed for:
    -   One first generation 'conceptual intercourse' t-shirt
    -   <More To Come Soon>
