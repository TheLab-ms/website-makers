Thursday March 3rd 19:00 Brew Night
-----------------------------------

Join TheLab.ms for a Brew Night event on Thursday March 3rd (Postponed
from Feb 25th) at 7 PM. The event will be held in the garage/driveway of
[703 Cypress Drive in Allen TX 75002](https://goo.gl/maps/l7MTr). This
event is open to anyone over 21 years of age who wishes to spectate and
learn the brewing process. However, only paying members of TheLab.ms
over 21 years of age can participate in brewing their own batch.

This brew night will have TheLab.ms members craft a recipe from scratch
using any of a number of different ingredients that will be available.
Members will learn how to use the BeerSmith software to create a recipe
and then share that recipe online. Then we will brew the recipe that is
created.

If you are a paying member of TheLab.ms over 21 years of age and wish to
participate in brewing your own batch, then you will need to add a
comment to this event indicating that so we can purchase your
ingredients. Other than the ingredients you will need to bring all your
own equipment.

We look forward to seeing you at the event!
