Friday September 23rd 19:00 Brew Night
-----------------------------------

Join TheLab.ms for a special Root Beer Brew Night event on Friday September 23rd at 7 PM.

The event will be held in the garage/driveway of [703 Cypress Drive in Allen TX 75002](https://goo.gl/maps/l7MTr). 

This event is open to anyone over 21 years of age who wishes to learn how to make thier own Root Beer.


This special brew night event will have TheLab.ms members and other attendees make thier own Root Beer.
The process of making Root Beer mirrors some of the same steps used in beer brewing.
But, the goal of the yeast process for Root Beer is carbonation only and NOT alcohol creation.


We have enough ingreedients for everyone who shows up to make some Root Beer and take a bottle home.
We have enough bottles for about a dozen attendees, so feel free to bring a 1 liter or 1 quart plastic soda bottle. (2 liter bottles are too big)


### Required Equipment List For Brewers

-   A 1 liter or 1 quart plastic soda bottle (optional)
