### Outline of the event

-   Clean and Sanitize everything.
-   Start heating just under 4 Gal of water to 162 F for the mash.
-   Add PH stabilizer to the water.
-   While mash water is heating mill all the grains.
-   Add the mash water at 162 F to the mash tun (adding grains will
    reduce this to 152 F).
-   Add the grains to the mash tun stiring to release air trapped in the
    grains.
-   Cap the mash tun and let the grains steep at 152 F for 60 min.
-   Start heating about 4 1/2 Gal of water to 168 F for sparging about
    40 min after starting steep.
-   Add the sparge water at 168 F to the sparge bucket and secure hose
    for fly sparging.
-   Take first runnings from the mash testing sugar content to ensure
    completion
-   Fly sparge the mash adding the wort to the brew kettle at the same
    rate sparge water enters the mash tun
-   Stop collecting wort when you have just under 6 1/2 Gal or when
    runnings measure 1.010 specific gravity.
-   Start heating the wort to a boil.
-   Add bittering hops to the wort once it is at a rolling boil and
    start timing your 60 min boil time.
-   Add aroma hops to the wort 45 minutes into the boil (15 min
    remaining)
-   Add Ginger Root into the boil with 12 min remaining.
-   Add irish moss (clarifier) and yeast nutrient to the wort 50 minutes
    into the boil (10 min remaining)
-   Add Orange Peel and Cinnamon Stick into the boil with 5 min
    remaining.
-   When boil is finished remove from heat and crash cool the wort using
    a chiller
-   Once wort has reached approximately 80 F transfer to fermentation
    bucket
-   Take a specific gravity reading and record this as your original
    gravity
-   Pitch yeast and aerate.
-   Seal the fermenter with an airlock and wait for it to transform
    itself into the nectar of the gods.
