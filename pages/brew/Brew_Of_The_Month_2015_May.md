Thursday May 28th 19:00 Brew Night
----------------------------------

Join TheLab.ms for a Brew Night event on Thursday May 28th at 7 PM. The
event will be held in the garage/driveway of [703 Cypress Drive in Allen
TX 75002](https://goo.gl/maps/l7MTr). This event is open to anyone over
21 years of age who wishes to spectate and learn the brewing process.
However, only paying members of TheLab.ms over 21 years of age can
participate in brewing their own batch.

This month we will be video taping our brew night to provide online step
by step instructions on how to brew an all grain IPA. This months brew
has been named 'By The Numbers IPA' for this reason. It will be a
traditional american IPA. The majority of the grain will be 2 row with
just a bit of caramel malt for color. It will use Warrior hops to give
it that IPA bitter bite. It should turn out to be a perfect example of
an american IPA.

If you are a paying member of TheLab.ms over 21 years of age and wish to
participate in brewing your own batch, then you will need to add a
comment to this event indicating that so we can purchase your
ingredients. Other than the ingredients you will need to bring all your
own equipment. We have a set of equipment that can be rented from
TheLab.ms on a first come first serve basis.

We look forward to seeing you at the event!
