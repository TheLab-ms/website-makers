Business
--------

### 1st Order of business:

A motion has been raised regarding approving the update of the
supplemental rules wiki page to change the membership fees listed there
to the current amounts. This page was previously voted on as to require
a board vote to change in any way. So while this is a simple update to
the membership fees to correct the page that is currently listing last
years amounts, this change requires board approval.

Vote on the update of the supplemental rules wiki page to correct the
membership fees listed.

-   Vote: 4 in favor, 0 opposed, 1 abstained
-   Resolution: Vote passed

### 2nd Order of business:

A motion has been raised regarding approving the spend of \$175 for
event insurance for our first annual bash scheduled for June 11th. It
was determined that our current insurance would not be sufficient to
cover this event.

Vote on the spend of \$175 for event insurance.

-   Vote: 4 in favor, 0 opposed, 1 abstained
