Business
--------

### 1st Order of business:

A motion has been raised regarding our previous vote allowing Coffee Del Rey to use our Internet on [Board Meeting 2016-09-20](Board_Meeting_2016-09-20.html)
It has come to our attention that by providing Coffee Del Rey thier own SSID and subnet on the wireless access point this could be viewed as providing them extra services beyond what a normal member would recieve.
While the majority of leadership believe that this is something we would probably do for any member who had a need for it, we would rather error on the side of caution on this point.
The vote would be to remove any special setup on the wireless/internet for Coffee Del Rey including thier SSID and subnet, leaving them with the same basic access that any member would have (The owner of Coffee Del Rey is a member in good standing).

Vote on the motion BV_20170114_A:

-   Vote: 5 in favor, 0 opposed, 0 abstained
-   Resolution: Vote passed to remove any Coffee Del Rey specific configurations from wireless/internet.

### 2nd Order of business:

Quickbooks online is now offering non-profit pricing that would allow us to obtain a 5 user license for $50 per year.
This is something that could help us keep current with our financials and a motion has been raised to approve this expense.

Vote on the motion BV_20170114_B:

-   Vote: 5 in favor, 0 opposed, 0 abstained
-   Resolution: Vote passed

### 6th Order of business:

We continue to have unneeded items accumulate in the education center.  While some of this is junk that we can take to Goodwill, other items may provide monetary value to us should we sell them.  Our CTO Whiskeyneon has agreed to identify the unneeded items of value and work with a 3rd party auction service (such as the FedEx eBay Valet service) to turn these items into funding.  A motion is raised to allow our CTO to auction off our unneeded items using a 3rd party service (whose fees come out of the item sales). 

Vote on the motion BV_20170114_F:

-   Vote: 5 in favor, 0 opposed, 0 abstained
-   Resolution: Vote passed

### 7th Order of business:

Neil gave leadership a heads up about the possibility of his departure from leadership should he take a job out of the country.
He will know in the next few weeks if he will be leaving but wanted to let us know so we can start looking for a new facilities coordinator.

### 8th Order of business:

We discussed putting up small signs on the video cameras remining members that we may be recording and they the cameras should not be tampered with.
This is not a new rule and nothing to vote on, just a discussion and agrement to post reminder signs.
