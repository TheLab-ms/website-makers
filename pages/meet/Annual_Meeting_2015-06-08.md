  ----------------------- --------------------------------------- --------------------------- ---------------

NOTE: The Bylaw changed to adjust the weighting to include the floating
board members did not affect the results of this vote. The weights are
shown given the new amended bylaws weights as detailed here: "Votes for
each of the Directors shall be weighted as follows: There will be a
total of 9 votes: Each of the existing Directors have one vote, for a
total of 5. The majority vote of Voting Members will count as 4 votes."
However, even with the pre-amendment weights of 5 votes, 3 for directors
and 2 for majority of membership the results would have remained the
same in this case because the director vote was split. RESULTS: Here are
the new directors per the membership vote

  ----------------------- ----------------

  President               Shawn Porter
  Vice President          Roxy Dehart
  Secretary               Richard Gowen
  Floating Board Member   Don Powrie
  Floating Board Member   Tommy Falgout
