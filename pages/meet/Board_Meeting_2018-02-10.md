### 1st Order of business:

Due to the recent membership special election vote a tie was recieved with respect to the floating board member position that was vacant.
Brandon Hansford and Paul Ingendorf both recieved 18 member votes of the 36 votes cast.
There was one proxy vote that did not count due to a lack of voter identification.
There was a motion raised by the board to count this disenfranchised voter's vote for the position of floating board member as a way to break the tie.
This voter voted for Brandon Hansford for the position of floating board member.
The vote of the current board regarding accepting Brandon Hansford as the floating board member to break the tie is as follows:
