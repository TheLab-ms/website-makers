Business
--------

### 1st Order of business:

A motion has been raised regarding allowing our neihbor Coffee Del Rey to use our Internet.
They are willing to pay us a membership fee for access to the same wireless access point and Internet that members use.
After discussion amongst leadership it was thought best to provide a seperate SSID and subnet for them to use and there would have to be an agreement of best effort service levels (the same we provide our members).
 
Vote on the motion:

-   Vote: 5 in favor, 0 opposed, 0 abstained
-   Resolution: Vote passed to allow Coffee Del Rey to use our Internet if they sign up as a member.
