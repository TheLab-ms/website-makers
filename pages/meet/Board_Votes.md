A motion has been raised regarding our previous vote allowing Coffee Del Rey to use our Internet on [Board Meeting 2016-09-20](Board_Meeting_2016-09-20.html)
It has come to our attention that by providing Coffee Del Rey thier own SSID and subnet on the wireless access point this could be viewed as providing them extra services beyond what a normal member would recieve.
While the majority of leadership believe that this is something we would probably do for any member who had a need for it, we would rather error on the side of caution on this point.
The vote would be to remove any special setup on the wireless/internet for Coffee Del Rey including thier SSID and subnet, leaving them with the same basic access that any member would have (The owner of Coffee Del Rey is a member in good standing).

We continue to have unneeded items accumulate in the education center.  While some of this is junk that we can take to Goodwill, other items may provide monetary value to us should we sell them.  Our CTO Whiskeyneon has agreed to identify the unneeded items of value and work with a 3rd party auction service (such as the FedEx eBay Valet service) to turn these items into funding.  A motion is raised to allow our CTO to auction off our unneeded items using a 3rd party service (whose fees come out of the item sales).

### BV_20161027_A:

A motion has been raised regarding raising the previously approved spend amount on the SlingFest event.
Due to the large number of advanced ticket sales and projected door sales for the event it was determined that we would need additional parking.
Collin College has agreed to rent us some of thier parking spaces for the event.  
However, due to this forcing people to cross a busy street this will also require us to hire two off duty Plano Police officers to direct traffic.
The total additional expenses are estimated at $800.
This would be in addition to the previously approved $2500 amount from [Board Meeting 2016-09-11](Board_Meeting_2016-09-11.html) bringing the new total budgeted spend for SlingFest to $3300.

Vote on the motion BV_20161027_A:

-   Resolution: Vote passed to allow the spend of no more than $3300 total on the SlingFest event.

### BV_20160920_A:

A motion has been raised regarding allowing our neihbor Coffee Del Rey to use our Internet.
They are willing to pay us a membership fee for access to the same wireless access point and Internet that members use.
After discussion amongst leadership it was thought best to provide a seperate SSID and subnet for them to use and there would have to be an agreement of best effort service levels (the same we provide our members).
 
Vote on the motion BV_20160920_A:

-   Vote: 5 in favor, 0 opposed, 0 abstained
-   Resolution: Vote passed to allow Coffee Del Rey to use our Internet if they sign up as a member.

A motion has been raised regarding our stance on firearms at our facilities.
This is a carry over from the June 11th meeting where the vote was pushed.
Given the Texas laws regarding the open carry and concealed carry of firearms we need to determine our stance.
We can vote to prohibit all firearms (via penal code 30.06) at our facilities, or
We can vote to prohibit open cary of firearms (via penal code 30.07) at our facilities, or
We can vote to not place any prohibitions on firearms in which case both open and concealed carry would be allowed.
