Business

### 1st Order of business:

A motion has been raised regarding keeping the second 3D printer that we
got as part of the original order snafu. We had originally paid $1200
for the 3D printer then it went on sale for $1000. The only way to get
the sale price would be to order it again and return the original which
is what we did. The motion is to keep both 3D printers which would be an
additional spend of $1000 over the $2000 previously approved.
