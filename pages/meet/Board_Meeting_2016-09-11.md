Business
--------

### 1st Order of business:

A motion has been raised regarding our stance on firearms at our facilities.
This is a carry over from the June 11th meeting where the vote was pushed.
Given the Texas laws regarding the open carry and concealed carry of firearms we need to determine our stance.
We can vote to prohibit all firearms (via penal code 30.06) at our facilities, or
We can vote to prohibit open cary of firearms (via penal code 30.07) at our facilities, or
We can vote to not place any prohibitions on firearms in which case both open and concealed carry would be allowed.

Vote on the motion:

-   Vote: 4 in favor of open carry prohibition, 0 opposed, 1 abstained
-   Resolution: Vote passed to prohibit open cary of firearms (via penal code 30.07)

### 2nd Order of business:

A motion has been raised regarding approving the spend of no more than $2500 for
expenses related to Slingfest.  This includes insurance, park fee, and other expenses.

Vote on the motion:

-   Vote: 5 in favor, 0 opposed, 0 abstained
-   Resolution: Vote passed

### 3rd Order of business:

A motion has been raised to approve the Plano Magazine Slingfest sponsorship proposal terms.
Plano Magazine will provide the following:
Logo Design, Entry Flyer Design, Mention in print, Digital promotions,
Contacting and booking vendors, establishing vendor map, collecting vendor fees,
Establishing sponsor options, designing a sponsorship packet,
Produce a press packed with images and branding.
Terms for this sponsorship:
An 80/20 split on vendor and sponsor money with TheLab.ms getting 20%.
Since Perot Museum was secured before this deal it is not included in the 80/20.
TheLab.ms would retain 100% of ticket sales.
The term "sponsored by Plano Magazine and TheLab.ms" will be included on all marketing
and may be expanded to include other large sponsors of the event if needed.

Vote on the motion:

-   Vote: 5 in favor, 0 opposed, 0 abstained
-   Resolution: Vote passed

### 4th Order of business:

A motion has been raised regarding spending no more than $350 for expenses related to turning the Gas on.
This includes the $100 Plano inspection fee and $250 for a plumber to pressure test the lines.

Vote on the motion:

-   Vote: 5 in favor, 0 opposed, 0 abstained
-   Resolution: Vote passed

### 5th Order of business:

A motion has been raised regarding spending no more than $200 for a crash bar for the front door.
This will purchase the device with the assumption that we will attempt to install it ourselves.
Should installation be problematic a future vote will be needed to secure contract labor.

Vote on the motion:

-   Vote: 5 in favor, 0 opposed, 0 abstained
-   Resolution: Vote passed

### 6th Order of business:

A motion has been raised regarding getting rid of the junk in the back room by giving to members or charity.
Specifically the items that had been previously marked for auction in June and did not sell should be removed.
With the option to hold back a few of the higher dollar items we could allow members to take all else and then
anything left would be taken to the Goodwill.  This member take home event would happen at the next membership meeting.

Vote on the motion:

-   Vote: 5 in favor, 0 opposed, 0 abstained
-   Resolution: Vote passed

### 7th Order of business:

Regarding replacing the lights at the space with new LED units.  Greg has donated the first batch to test.
Assuming the test goes well we will need to spend money to upgrade all the lights.
We have the estimated costs for this effort but will push this vote to the next board meeting to wait for test results.

### 8th Order of business:

Our cleaning company, which is a $200/mo expense that was previously approved, has not been paid.
We need to get them paid ASAP.
In addition, they may be doing a poor job and not fulfilling all thier agreed to services.
This is most likely due to the lack of payment.
We should address this after we make prompt payment and look for a different service in the mean time.
It was mentioned that there is a member who would like to work on cleaning the space for membership points.
This was thought to be possible under our current rules not requiring a vote.
This would be in addition to not in place of a cleaning service.

### 9th Order of business

A previously approved expense for purchase of compute hardware for the space was not fully used and is needed now.
We agreed that since this was previously approved we could spend this money now without a new vote.
