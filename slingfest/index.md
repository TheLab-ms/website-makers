TheLab.ms--a Plano-area maker space--is excited to present the 6th Annual SlingFest on Sunday, October 30th beginning at 11:00 AM at Oak Point Park and Nature Preserve in Plano, TX.

## What is SlingFest?

SlingFest is an annual competition of compound machines exploiting leverage and gravity to fling pumpkins as far as possible. Competitors wage battle in five different categories in the competition: accuracy, distance, funky fling, crowd choice and builder choice.

## Tickets

Tickets can be purchased at the gate; $10 for adults (18+), $5 for kids aged 12-17, and free for kids under the age of 12. However if purchased in advance, all tickets will cost $5. Eventbrite - Purchase Advance Tickets No pets allowed.
